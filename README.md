# SocialRSS
This is still a pretty raw idea. I just wanted to save this and take some notes on it. It'd be an anti Facebook, if that sounds cool.

An RSS reader at it's core, would include social components as well. Basically I want creators to be able to own and host their own content but also have a shared social space. Finding, linking, commenting, and sharing content would also be a thing. I want to avoid the walled garden thing that other social media does. A lot more thought needs to go into that last part.
